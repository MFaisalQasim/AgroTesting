    <h2 class="get-in-touch">Starting <span>the</span> tractor</h2>
    <div>
        <p class="text-touch" style="font-size: 20px;">Now as you have checked the tractor components, it’s time to start the tractor and, there you go for work. Sit comfortably on your driver’s seat, press the choke completely with the levers in a neutral position, place the key in the ignition and turn the key clockwise direction for the first step and, then again turn the key clockwise direction for the second time and here you will see that your tractor is coming to life and then third clockwise turn will start your engine completely and release the key, your work isn’t completely done here, you have to turn the key in ignition counterclockwise once and then after 20 seconds turn it again clockwise to finally be good to go.

    </div>
    <h2 class="get-in-touch">Shutting <span>off the</span> tractor</h2>
<div>
    <p class="text-touch" style="font-size: 20px;">Now you are good to go on starting the tractor, let's guide you on how to shut it off safely and accurately. When it is time to get home and to shut off the tractor, just press the clutch and, get all your gears to neutral, then pull out the choke as far as you can and turn the key in an anti-clockwise direction and, take it to initial point and, get the key out.
        On a side note, for a turbo engine, keep your engine running at the lowest speed, either before shutting off or starting your tractor. Do not just start and press the accelerator, it’s not safe. </p>

    <h2 class="get-in-touch">Engine <span>Main</span>tenance</h2>
<div >
    <p class="text-touch" style="font-size: 20px;">Engine is the heart of a tractor. Taking care of a tractor engine is of the utmost importance because you just can’t work without a healthy heart. Most of the tractors malfunction because they are not properly maintained. To have the best performance and long life guaranteed, you need to have proper maintenance of the engine.
        Understand your machine and use it according to its designed speed and gear. Try not to leave the engine running if the tractor is not in use, turn off the engine rather than letting the tractor idly standing and start whenever needed. </p>
